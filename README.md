# Irises - revisited

I had always intended to come back to the Iris problem.

On my first attempt, I simplified the problem to just two classes of Iris, and used a simple perceptron model to linearly separate them.

This time around, I have experience using neural networks and keras, so I wanted to apply what I've learned to the three-class Iris problem.
